## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
source("./superscript.r")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
testing_99 %>% 
  st_transform(crs = "+init=epsg:4326") %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider = "CartoDB.Positron") %>%
  addPolygons(popup = popup_testing99,
              stroke = FALSE,
              smoothFactor = 0,
              fillOpacity = 0.6,
              color = ~ pal3(student_count),
              highlightOptions = highlightOptions(color = "white", weight = 2,
                                                  bringToFront = TRUE)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", 
            pal = pal3, 
            values = ~ student_count,
            title = "Student Count",
            opacity = 1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r geometry}
colorado_income <- get_acs(geography = "school district (unified)",
                           variables = "B19013_001",
                           state = "CO", key = apikey)

colorado_school <- school_districts(state = "CO",
                                    type = "unified",
                                    class = "sf")

co_school_joined <- left_join(colorado_school,
                              colorado_income,
                              by = "GEOID")

# Remove 
rm("colorado_income", 'colorado_school')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r profiles}
profiles <- read_excel("./data/blueprint_designed/SFA_profile_Feb_2019.xls", 
                       col_types = c("text", "text", "text","logical", 
                                     "numeric","numeric", 
                                     "numeric", "logical",
                                     "logical", "logical", 
                                     "logical","logical"))

profiles <- profiles %>% 
  dplyr::rename(CDE_AGREEMENT = "Sponsor #", 
                day4 = "4 Day School Week",
                student_count = "Pupil Count",
                free_perc = "Free %",
                redu_perc = "Reduced-Price %", 
                sbp = "Breakfast", 
                nslp = "Lunch",
                smp = "Milk",
                snack = "Snack",
                sfsp = "SFSP",
                sfa_name = "Sponsor Name") %>% 
  mutate(sfa_name = str_to_lower(sfa_name)) %>% 
  mutate(free_students = free_perc * student_count) %>% # count of free students
  mutate(redu_students = redu_perc * student_count) %>% # count of redu students
  mutate(free_and_red_perc = free_perc + redu_perc) # combined free & redu


# The above actually takes the raw excel into a semi-usable dataframe
profiles <- filter(profiles, Profile == "Public")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r geoid_to_sfa}
